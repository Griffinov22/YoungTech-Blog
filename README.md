# Young Tech

This is a personal full stack web application to get me introduced to:

- SQL
- Azure Authentication
- Azure web hosting
- and NodeJS

## My Notes

- The gif logo has a time length of 1.16s
  - use a useEffect to set a timer for (1.16s \* rotations), then set the logo image's src to the static version so it's not super annoying
